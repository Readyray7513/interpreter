# Simple Arithmetic Calculator
This Python program evaluates an arithmetic expression input by the user and outputs the result. It handles basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

How to Use:
Run the script.
When prompted, enter an arithmetic expression using the format: <number> <operator> <number>, for example, 5 + 3 or 12 * 2.
The program will compute and display the result of the expression, rounded to one decimal place.

Example:
Input:
Enter an arithmetic expression (e.g., 1 + 1): 4 + 5
Output:
9.0

Input:
Enter an arithmetic expression (e.g., 1 + 1): 7 / 3
Output:
2.3

Supported Operators:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division

How It Works:
The program prompts the user to input an arithmetic expression.
It splits the input into three parts: the first number (x), the operator (y), and the second number (z).
The program converts the numbers to integers and performs the operation based on the operator.
The result of the operation is printed, formatted to one decimal place.
